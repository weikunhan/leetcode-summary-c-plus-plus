# Basic Data Structures

The data structures you should know before starting coding in LeetCode:

* Array
* Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Binary Tree
* Binary Search Tree
* Red-Black Tree
* Heap
* Hash Table
* Graph
* Advanced Data Structure

For more information, you need to check related courses and books. Here, most basic data structures are:

* [Array](##Array)
* [Linked List](##Linked-List)
* [String (Not a data structure)](##String)

## Array

Array is the most simple data structure. For some numerical data-related jobs, you should consider using some standard libraries such as NumPy. For programming practice, you need to know how to: 1)iterate through an array, 2)play tricks using different programming languages, 3)understand bit manipulation

## Linked List

Linked List is harder to understand for people who just starting programming. You should know when should use Array or Linked List. This type of problem includes: 1)delete elements in the linked list, 2)insert elements in the linked list. 3)merge elements from two linked lists 4)rotate elements in a linked list, 5)copy special linked list

## String

String is not a data structure but many coding problems play with it. For some data processing related jobs, Sting is an extremely important topic. You should consider using a standard library for your daily work. However, for programming practice, you need to solve this kind of problem and familiar with: 1)sorting method/syntax, 2)split and join syntax, 3)encoding and decoding method/syntax, 4)regular expression, 5)hash mapping, 6)Unix utilities(optional)
